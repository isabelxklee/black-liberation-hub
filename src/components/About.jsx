        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I started the Ember Collective to help consolidate resources for supporting Black people. As a non-Black person of color, I wanted to use my time and resources to support the Black Lives Matter movement. I hope that you come away from visiting this site with more knowledge and energy to continue fighting anti-Black racism.</p>
        <p>Love,</p>
        <p>Isabel K. Lee</p>
